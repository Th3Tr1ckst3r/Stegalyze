A Python3-based program for detecting the presence of steganography through unconventional means. A word of caution, certain projects may
use similar techniques to achieve the same thing, so if you have one, or more positives it is very likely that the file your testing contains the 
presence of steganography.

# Introduction

Real-world cyber threats change everyday, but were starting to see a shift in the way cyber threat actors hide data, & malware. For those that don't know,
Steganography is the digital version of invisible ink to paper. Just as the very encryption we use every single day to browse the web, can be traced back in
history to classical ciphers like the Caesar cipher. They all paved the way to where we are now, respectively. As such, they tend to go unnoticed, as we dont always
think about what encryption is being used by big corporations, & Uncle Same to secure our data. Even now as data brokers sell our data to the highest bidder, it goes unnoticed.

That, itself, is Steganography in the digital age. It goes unnoticed in the exact same way. It can be presented as an art, a tool, & even a threat. If history has
taught us anything, from espionage, to digital privacy, & internet freedoms. Its that if we truly want to be ahead of the curve, we must understand it first.

# Why look for Steganography?

Let's use a real world example of what could happen if steganography is involved in a cyber attack, & why we should all be monitoring files of any kind:

```
Bob has a friend named Alice, & Alice works in an office setting with Bob. Alice sent Bob a picture via email of a kitten she claimed to have gotten that day. Later on,
Bob receives another email from Alice on his laptop, containing a PDF of pictures that Alice has taken of her new kitten. Bob thought this was really cute, & thought nothing
of it. Bob gets home, & decides he wants to get some extra work done from home. Bob gets on his laptop when suddenly he can't. His laptop has stopped working all together,
so in the morning he takes his laptop into the shop to see if they can fix it. Before Bob could get a word in, his boss asks him to take a seat. Suddenly, he is made aware
that things have taken a turn for the worst. Bob is informed that he was a victim of a network phishing campaign, & that his email had been compromised. Bob didn't know
exactly what this meant, but it sure got his attention. His boss also informed Bob that his email was used by the attackers to spread the same set of documents to his
coworkers. Suddenly, Bob feels his job security is at risk, he has a family to provide for, & this could jeopardize everything he has worked so hard to achieve. Not to mention
the thought of this causing even more trouble for his coworkers, & Bob had no idea.
```

So, what can we learn from this example? 

Well, that first email Bob got from who he thought was Alice containing a picture of a innocent kitten that Bob received was used as a cover by the attacker. Abusing your trust to carry
a piece of malware from point A to point B. As for the second email that Bob had received from Alice, that innocent looking PDF also contained a malicious payload that when opened 
would extract, & execute the malware without Bob even knowing it. At that point, it was too late for Bob, & the network the company he works for. 

That being said, as antivirus vendors, and security/threat analysts are not always monitoring all the files through the network. This real world example highlights why its just as important
to not underestimate a file, document, or picture simply because of its type, how it works, or the data that it contains. As Steganography is in, & of itself the art of hiding its own existence.
